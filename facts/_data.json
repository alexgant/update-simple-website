		"text":"I have way too many consoles and video games, most of which I either haven't finished  or haven't played at all! I have about 8 different consoles, 4 hand-helds, and a gaming PC. I actually don't spend a lot of time gaming, but when I do I tend to go all out and will play the games for 10+ hours a day for like 2 solid weeks."

		"text":"I love posters and art, mostly from comic books and video games. I do not like having just 'official game art', I usually prefer concept art or art from Indie developers. But I also have way too many posters and not enough wall space for them so they just sit in poster tubes until I decide to play tetris on my walls again."

	"fact3":{
		"title": "Fact #3",
		"text":"I tend to get obsessive with Indie Developers and tend to just play their games and focus on those. Although I am an avid Zelda fan, I do tend to prefer indie games. Right now I am currently obsessed with Supergiant Games and Night School Studio. Especially the art and music from supergiant games (the transistor soundtrack is my go-to for when I'm coding)."

		"text":"I love to bake! I actually make commission cakes/cupcakes/treats as sort of a supplement income thing. I started really getting into baking about 3 years ago and I picked up on it really quickly. I spent a good while researching the chemistry behind baking because I wanted to make my recipers perfect, and I feel like I've done it. It low-key drives my friends insane when they try to bake with me because I am so percise and often times don't let them do anything."
